In-class Activities
-------------------

During each class session you will be engaged in a variety of writing activities that use self-editing, peer-editing, and instructor feedback to develop your skills. The goal of these exercises is to limber you up and make you more flexible as writers, revisers, and editors. They will also prepare you for the out-of-class writing assignments.

In addition, during each session three or four students will be responsible for a brief (no more than 5 minutes each) oral presentation on a particular aspect of an assigned research article. The four assigned roles for these presentation are to 1) summarize the article, 2) analyze the article according to the goals of that particular component of a scientific research paper, 3) analyze the article according to the pitfalls of that particular component of a scientific research paper, 4) act as a discussion leader and ask two to three open-ended questions to class.

Out-of-Class Writing
--------------------

Out-of-class exercises will put in-class experience to work on scientific content. You will experiment with the relationship between audience and style/format, as well as explore and critique writing the readings assigned for each class. Further descriptions of out-of-class exercises will be provided during each class meeting.

Long-Term Project ({{% resource_link fb2ed9b3-fb6a-0597-9986-6c5b44e9185b "PDF" %}})
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to various in-class and out-of-class exercises, you will be asked to choose one on-going writing project. Each choice will require that you turn in sections of the whole at each class meeting and regularly revise those sections based on instructor and peer feedback. You will then hand in a final version of your project at the end of the semester. **Please note:** The first section to your long-term project - the introduction - will be due before the second class meeting and some preliminary work on your project will be done at the first class meeting; thus, please make your topic choice as soon as possible. Choices are as follows:

*   7.02 / 10.702 Experience: Write a reflective research article on yourself as a student learning the laboratory techniques and biological content of 7.02 / 10.702.
    
*   Mendel Paper: Use selected data and related aspects of the experimental design from Mendel's original paper to write a shortened, more contemporary scientific paper.
    
*   Oswald Avery paper: Use selected data and related aspects of the experimental design from Avery et. al.'s original paper isolating DNA as the "active principle" involved in transfer of genetic material and write a shortened, more persuasive, and more contemporary scientific paper.
    
*   UROP: Use the data and experimental design from your independent research to compose a research article suitable for publication in a scholarly journal.
    
*   Interviews: Investigate the process of writing scientific research and the "norms" of well written research articles by interviewing working scientists and collecting examples.
    
*   Textual Analysis: Conduct a textual analysis of a series of scientific research articles on a single topic.
